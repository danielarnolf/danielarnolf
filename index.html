<p dir="ltr">With the hype surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies lately, everyone seems to be interested in investing in crypto. However, just like with any other investment, you need to assess the situation and figure out if it&rsquo;s a smart investment. For those that want to get started with Bitcoin investment but don&rsquo;t have a clear idea on how to start or how to make it a safe experience, we put together some essential information. Check out some tips and advice on how to safely invest in Bitcoin and take advantage of the record-breaking behavior of this cryptocurrency recently.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Get Rid of the FOMO Symptoms</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;ve never invested in Bitcoin before, seeing the spectacular growth in February and March will certainly trigger some serious &ldquo;FOMO symptoms&rdquo; (Fear Of Missing Out). For those that are not familiar with the term, FOMO is that feeling you&rsquo;ve just missed out on an excellent investment opportunity and you will never get a second chance. However, this way of seeing things isn&rsquo;t appropriate if you want to smartly invest in Bitcoin. Instead, you need to evaluate the performance of cryptocurrency during a longer time period. The <a href="https://www.arabfinancials.org/تقييم-أداء-العملات-الرقمية-المشفرة/">process of long-term evaluation of a specific cryptocurrency</a> before investing in other digital currencies is well described in an article published by the website Arab Financials and helpful to anyone experiencing FOMO symptoms. Just like gold-diggers in the past that all went to search for the precious metal in places only confirmed by rumors, modern-day Bitcoin investors tend to show a crowd mentality. You need to disconnect from all the success stories and other stuff like that and only follow the data that is actually relevant to your goal. Like with any other investment move, you need to lay a good plan and follow it to make a profit.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t Always Trust Your Subconscious</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Many beginner investors tend to go with their gut feeling instead of brains when it comes to making money. If you have a &lsquo;good feeling&rsquo; about another Bitcoin spike in the future, it&rsquo;s not necessary for it to actually happen. Indeed, there has been a lot of progress from the times when Bitcoin was only available for online casino payments to the point we're in today when you can buy cars, and even pay your bills with cryptocurrency. However, you should always check the statistics, follow the news, and gather data that could support such a spike. For example, you can look at what happened when Tesla bought $1,5bn of Bitcoin causing the crypto to spike early in February. Sure, everyone was saying that Bitcoin will blow up in 2021. However, without moves like this one from Tesla, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to predict a spike. And the 17% spike to reach $44,220 was something that could have been predicted if you followed Tesla&rsquo;s investment policy announcement back in January. They announced they will use digital currencies, gold bullion, and gold exchange-traded funds for their future investments.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">&nbsp;Make Peace with the Possibility of Losing</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Every investor, no matter if we&rsquo;re talking about Bitcoin or anything else, needs to be aware that losing is part of the game. Ask any big, successful investor out there for a story about when they lost and they&rsquo;ll have tens of such stories. Just like trying to predict the Bitcoin spikes, you can see warning signs of a massive drop. However, doing so isn&rsquo;t a straightforward procedure and it&rsquo;s mostly a matter of luck or other events that you can&rsquo;t control. Since we mentioned how Tesla and Elon Musk positively influenced the Bitcoin price in February when they bought massive amounts of the cryptocurrency, let&rsquo;s look at how the same guy caused a massive drop.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Towards the end of the month, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/bitcoin-btc-price-down-10percent-after-elon-musk-says-prices-seem-high.html#:~:text=Musk%20recently%20came%20out%20as,as%20payment%20for%20its%20products">Elon Musk started a series of tweets</a> in which he answered Peter Schiff stating that holding gold digitally isn&rsquo;t the same thing as actually investing in physical gold. The Tesla CEO continued saying that you might as well have crypto. It first looked that Musk is defending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a trend that will lead to a further increase. However, the next day, Elon managed to drop Bitcoin&rsquo;s price by more than 10% with another tweet saying: &ldquo;That said, BTC &amp; ETH do seem high lol&rdquo;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That single tweet caused Bitcoin to drop to $51,993 after a stunning rally that saw it reach an all-time record of $57,489. Of course, it&rsquo;s impossible to follow every social media account and know about massive Bitcoin sales around the globe. However, it goes to show that investing in this cryptocurrency and all others exposes you to risk. Just like any other investment, really.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, despite the ups and downs registered by Bitcoin in the past years, the digital coin is still up more than 80% in 2021 and that&rsquo;s very promising for anyone looking to invest in it to make a profit.</p>
